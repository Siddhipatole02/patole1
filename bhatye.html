    	A tiny village situated close to Ratnagiri city, Bhatye is known for its 1.5 km long stretch of a straight and clear beach with flat sea showers. Bhatye Beach is one of the most secluded and serene beaches in Ratnagiri.
The beach is not that crowded either. You can go for a morning walk, laze around and soak in the beauty, play beach ball or football or just stroll around collecting sea shells. The sand is so soft that you can just dust it off your body. It doesnâ€™t stick.
Enjoy beautiful views of the Ratnagiri lighthouse and the famous Mandavi Beach from here. The sunrise and sunset from Kohinoor is a sight to behold!
